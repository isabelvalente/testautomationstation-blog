## Why Automation Testing Still Matters in the Age of AI

We’re deep into the AI era. Chatbots can write code, AI copilots suggest test cases, and there’s constant buzz about replacing manual and automated testing with self-healing, AI-driven test tools. But despite all this, automation testing is **not only still relevant — it's critical**.

Here’s why:

- **AI still needs guardrails**: Just because an AI can generate code doesn’t mean it's correct, secure, or scalable. We still need robust test frameworks to validate what AI builds.
- **Test automation is evolving, not vanishing**: New tools use AI, but they still rely on solid foundations in Selenium, Playwright, Cucumber, and CI/CD practices.
- **AI introduces new risks**: Automated testing helps mitigate the risk of unpredictable AI behaviors and biased outputs by enabling structured, repeatable validations.

Automation isn’t obsolete — it's simply **changing shape**, and those who adapt will stay ahead.

## Current Skills Gaps in Automation Testing (UK Perspective)

Working in the UK tech landscape, one thing is clear: **the demand for automation testers hasn’t slowed down**, but the expectations have shifted. Some key gaps I’ve noticed:

- **Testers who can code confidently**: There's a growing need for testers who can build frameworks, not just use them. Java, C#, Python, and TypeScript are in high demand.
- **CI/CD integration knowledge**: Testers are expected to contribute to pipelines, work with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and understand containerization.
- **API and performance testing**: Many testers still lack hands-on experience with RESTful API testing tools (Postman, RestAssured) and load testing solutions (JMeter, k6).
- **Cloud fluency**: With infrastructure moving to AWS, Azure, or GCP, automation testers need at least a foundational understanding of cloud environments.
- **Soft skills + domain knowledge**: Beyond tooling, testers who understand the business context and communicate risks clearly are rare and invaluable.

In short, **it's not about automation testing dying — it’s about testers needing to evolve beyond click-based test scripts**.

## Why I’m Still Excited About Automation Testing — And Starting This Blog

After 6 years in automation testing — from public sector projects to agile product teams — I can confidently say I’m still just as passionate, maybe more.

Here’s why:

- **I love problem-solving**. Every flaky test, broken pipeline, or new requirement is a puzzle waiting to be cracked.
- **I see the impact**. Good automation saves hours of manual work, catches regressions early, and boosts team confidence.
- **The field keeps changing**. New tools, languages, and frameworks mean there’s always something to learn.
- **I believe in craftsmanship**. A well-structured test suite is like clean code — elegant, maintainable, and meaningful.

I’ve decided to start this blog to:
- Share tips, lessons learned, and real-world experience
- Reflect on what’s working (and what’s not) in test automation
- Hopefully help someone else out there navigate this field

Whether you're just starting out or already deep in the trenches, I hope you find something here that informs, challenges, or inspires you.

Welcome to the blog.
